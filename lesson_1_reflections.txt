How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
    it was actually nice to see how u can use the command line to see hoew different files and
    spotting bugs with in a file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
    It helps one to go back to the previous version to see changes made and also to check for bugs between the versions
    of the files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
    automatically committing is not about a person rather the software while in git its about a programmer's 
    judgemnt when to commit which may be disadvantageous because a programmer does not know when to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
    its because git allows programmers to tract changes between files that they are working on.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    git diff to check the difference between two files and git log to check the tje commit history of the project

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    i can go back to the working versions of the code even tho i make a bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    For my android projects
