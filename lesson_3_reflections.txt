When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  if i want other people to see the project am working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Just in case i dont want the changes to be public yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is to make a clone-like repo on github
  clone is to make a copy of someoone's repo on ur local machine
  Branches are versions of ur local project.
  I would use fork when i want to conribute to anothers project 
  i would use clone when i want to copy someone else's project on my local machine
  i would use branches when am may be adding a new feature on my project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  IT can be accessible offine and changes would be upto date.
